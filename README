This project is our customized version of the famous and legendary game "Icy Tower"

4.
There is a main controller that hold the window and different components and provide the
needed support fot the components.

The game based on different componnets.
Each component represents one pice of the game such the menu, score board, the game itself etc.

The component hold different views, and synchronize the data between them, and contains the
relevant logic.

The graphic parts are seperated from the components by the views.
view is an object that take care only for the graphical part (sfml only),
what give the opportunity to reuse the different views and let the component take care only for
logic stuff.

A view can be built or based on some other views.

A Singelton design pattern uses to manage all extenal resources such as music and images.
A Command design pattern uses for the menu different options.

We used the STL data structures such the Map for the resources
Vedtor for general purposes
list used to save the tower floors becasue we need a mix of queue functionallity
and iterator to run on the elements
